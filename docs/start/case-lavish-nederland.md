## 🚨 Crisis Situation: Dead Social Media (2 Likes per Post)

**Reality Check:**
Lavish Nederland's Facebook posts krijgen **2 likes maximaal**. Voor een lifestyle drankenmerk in de uitgaansscene is dit catastrofaal - zero engagement, zero virality, zero brand awareness.

**Root Cause Analysis (Week 1):**

**Data Analyst + Social Manager Audit:**
```
Facebook Account Health Check:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ Posting frequency: 1x per week (inconsistent)
❌ Content type: Product shots only (boring, static)
❌ Captions: Generic promo text (no personality)
❌ Timing: Random (missing peak party hours)
❌ Video content: 0% (algorithm death sentence)
❌ User-generated content: Never shared
❌ Event coverage: Non-existent
❌ Influencer tags: Not leveraged
❌ Stories: Never used
❌ Hashtags: Generic (#cocktail) - no trend riding
❌ Engagement: Zero replies, zero community

Diagnosis: DEAD LIFESTYLE BRAND ACCOUNT
Root cause: Treating drinks brand like B2B product catalog
Reality: Lavish = lifestyle/party brand, needs energy & FOMO
Prognosis: Highly recoverable (party/drink content = naturally viral)
Timeline: 4-6 weeks to explosive growth
```

**Instagram Check (Current State):**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Posts: Product photos only
Likes: 15-30 per post (follower base: 2,400)
Engagement rate: 1.2% (industry avg: 3-6%)
Stories: Occasional, no consistency
Reels: 0 (missing viral potential)
Hashtags: Generic, not trending
UGC: Not utilized
Event coverage: None posted

Diagnosis: UNDERPERFORMING
Potential: MASSIVE (drinks + nightlife = viral combo)
```

## 🎯 Why This Works for Drinks Brands

**Lavish Success Factors:**

1. **Visual Product**
   - Cocktails are Instagram/TikTok gold
   - Colors, garnishes, presentation = scroll-stopping
   - Video shows the "experience" not just product

2. **Lifestyle Association**
   - Not selling drinks, selling "the Lavish life"
   - Party, festivals, good times = emotional connection
   - FOMO drives engagement & sharing

3. **UGC Machine**
   - Customers naturally photo/video drinks at parties
