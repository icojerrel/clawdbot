### 📚 SECTION 2: The 5 Essential Techniques (600 words)

#### 1. **SHAKING** (High Energy Cocktails)
**When:** Fruit juices, cream, egg white
**How:**
- Fill shaker with ice (2/3 full)
- Add ingredients (coldest first)
- Shake hard for 10-15 sec
- Strain immediately

**Lavish Example:** Green Apple Absinthe Shake
```
- 50ml Lavish Green Apple
- 25ml fresh lime juice
- 15ml simple syrup
- Shake hard, strain, serve ice cold
```

**Pro Tip:** "You know it's good when your shaker gets frost on the outside."

---

#### 2. **STIRRING** (Spirit-Forward Classics)
**When:** Whiskey, gin, clear spirits only
**How:**
- Add ice + ingredients to mixing glass
- Stir smoothly for 30-45 sec
- Don't splash or over-dilute
- Strain into chilled glass

**Lavish Example:** Vodka Martini Supreme
```
- 60ml Lavish Premium Vodka
- 15ml dry vermouth
- Stir, strain, olive garnish
```

**Pro Tip:** "Stir like you're conducting an orchestra - smooth, controlled, no panic movements."

---

#### 3. **MUDDLING** (Fresh Flavor Extraction)
**When:** Herbs, fruit, sugar cubes
**How:**
- Place ingredients in shaker
- Press gently with muddler (don't destroy)
- Rotate glass, press 3-4 times
- Add liquid + ice

**Lavish Example:** Lavish Mojito 2.0
```
- 8-10 fresh mint leaves
- 20ml lime juice
- 15ml simple syrup
- Muddle gently
- Add 50ml Lavish White Rum + soda
```

**Common Mistake:** "Over-muddling mint = bitter taste. Be gentle, extract oils only."

---

#### 4. **LAYERING** (Visual Showstopper)
**When:** B52, Irish Coffee, Instagram-worthy drinks
**How:**
- Pour heaviest liquid first
- Use bar spoon back to slow pour
- Each layer settles based on density

**Lavish Example:** Sunset Layer Shot
```
Bottom: Grenadine (heavy)
Middle: Orange juice
Top: Lavish Vodka (light)
```

**Pro Tip:** "Temperature matters - cold ingredients layer better."

---

#### 5. **DRY SHAKE** (Silky Foam Creation)
**When:** Egg white, aquafaba cocktails
**How:**
- Shake ingredients WITHOUT ice (15 sec)
- Add ice, shake again (10 sec)
- Strain for perfect foam layer

**Lavish Example:** Lavish Sour Deluxe
```
- 50ml Lavish Whiskey
- 25ml lemon juice
- 20ml simple syrup
- 1 egg white
- Dry shake first, then ice shake
```

### 📚 SECTION 3: Understanding Flavor Profiles (400 words)

**The Flavor Wheel:**

1. **Sweet** (Balance, not overpower)
   - Simple syrup, honey, agave
   - Rule: Measure precisely, taste adjust

2. **Sour** (Brightness + Contrast)
   - Citrus: lemon, lime, grapefruit
   - Fresh-squeezed only (no bottled!)

3. **Bitter** (Complexity + Depth)
   - Campari, Angostura bitters, absinthe
   - Small amounts = big impact

4. **Umami/Savory** (Unexpected Wow)
   - Tomato juice, olive brine, herbs
   - Trending: Jalapeño, basil, rosemary

**The Golden Ratio:**
```
2:1:1 = Base Spirit : Sour : Sweet
(Example: 60ml vodka : 30ml citrus : 30ml syrup)
```

**Lavish Signature Balance:**
"Our cocktails are engineered for perfection. Premium spirits paired with natural ingredients - zero artificial sweeteners, zero compromises."
