[Quick cut montage: Shaking, pouring, garnishing - fast pace]

"I'm [Name], and today I'm teaching you the Lavish Masterclass - five
bar-quality cocktails you can easily make at home."

[Hold up Lavish bottle]

"We're using Lavish premium cocktails as our base, but I'll also show you

[Point to camera]

"Everything you need: timestamps in the description, full recipes on our
blog, and a free cheat sheet to download. Let's make you a cocktail master."

### [00:45-02:30] RECIPE 1: THE AMSTERDAM NIGHT

**Transition:** Swoosh sound effect

**Visual:** Overhead camera angle (ingredients visible)

**Script:**
```
"The Amsterdam Night - this is Lavish's signature cocktail. It's refreshing,
slightly floral, and perfect for summer parties or rooftop bars."

[Gather ingredients on camera]

"You'll need:
- 50ml Lavish Premium Vodka
- 20ml elderflower liqueur
- 15ml fresh lime juice
- 3 cucumber slices
- Soda water to top
- Ice"

[Start process]

"First, muddle the cucumber gently in your shaker. You want to extract
the oils and juice, but don't destroy it - be gentle."

[Demonstrate muddling technique]

"Now add your vodka, elderflower, and lime juice. Fill the shaker
two-thirds with ice."

[Pour ingredients, camera close-up on measurements]

"Pro tip: Always measure. Consistency is what makes a good cocktail great."

[Shake vigorously]

"Shake hard for 10 seconds. You'll know it's ready when frost forms on
the outside of your shaker."

[Strain into glass]

"Double strain into a highball glass filled with fresh ice. This removes
any cucumber pulp for a super smooth finish."

[Top with soda]

"Top with soda water - about 50ml. Don't stir too much; you want those
bubbles."

[Garnish]

"Garnish with a cucumber ribbon and a small elderflower sprig if you're
feeling fancy."

[Hold finished cocktail to camera]

"The Amsterdam Night. Floral, fresh, and absolutely delicious."

[Take sip, react positively]

"Perfect."

### [02:30-04:15] RECIPE 2: FESTIVAL FUEL

**Transition:** Quick beat drop

**Script:**
```
"Next up: Festival Fuel. This is our high-energy cocktail - perfect for
pre-gaming before a night out or festivals."

[Warning gesture]

"Now, this one's got caffeine, so maybe don't drink five of these before
bed. Trust me on that."

[Ingredients]

"You need:
- 50ml Lavish Energy Mix
- 100ml Red Bull (or energy drink of choice)
- 15ml fresh lime juice
- Fresh mint leaves
- Ice"

[Build drink]

"This is a build cocktail, not shaken. Fill your glass with ice first."

[Add ingredients]

"Add your Lavish Energy Mix, lime juice, then gently slap the mint
between your palms."

[Demonstrate mint slap]

"See that? Slapping releases the oils without bruising the leaves.
Drop them in."

[Top with Red Bull]

"Top with Red Bull. Use a bar spoon to gently lift the mint through
the drink - this distributes the flavor evenly."

[Garnish]

"Garnish with a lime wheel and a big mint sprig. This one's all about
that fresh, energizing vibe."

[Present drink]

"Festival Fuel. Your pre-party essential."
```

**On-Screen Text:**

### [04:15-06:00] RECIPE 3: VELVET ESPRESSO MARTINI

**Transition:** Smooth fade

**Script:**
```
"Now for the classic with a Lavish twist: The Velvet Espresso Martini."

[Serious tone]

"This is probably my favorite cocktail of all time. It's smooth, it's
caffeinated, it's basically dessert in a glass."

[Ingredients]

"You'll need:
- 50ml Lavish Premium Vodka
- 30ml fresh espresso (cooled)
- 20ml coffee liqueur
- 10ml simple syrup
- 3 coffee beans for garnish"

[Important note]

"Key thing: your espresso needs to be fresh but COOLED. Hot espresso
will water down your drink and melt your ice too fast."

[Dry shake]

"This one gets a dry shake first - that means no ice. We want to create
that signature foam layer."

[Shake without ice]

"Shake for 15 seconds without ice."

[Add ice and shake again]

"Now add ice and shake hard for another 10 seconds. Really go for it."

[Strain]

"Double strain into a chilled martini glass. See that foam layer forming?
That's what we want."

[Garnish]

"Three coffee beans on top - tradition says they represent health, wealth,
and happiness."

[Present]

"The Velvet Espresso Martini. Smooth, sophisticated, absolutely stunning."

**Transition:** Upbeat music kick

**Script:**
```
"Recipe four: The Neon Paloma. If you're a tequila fan, this is your
new favorite drink."

[Upbeat energy]

"This one's all about that pink glow - it literally glows under UV light
at parties, which is kind of insane."

[Ingredients]

"You need:
- 50ml Lavish Tequila
- 100ml grapefruit soda (Jarritos or similar)
- 15ml fresh lime juice
- Salt for rim
- Ice"

[Salt rim]

"First, let's do a proper salt rim. Rub lime around half the glass - only
half, so people can choose salted or not."

[Demonstrate rim technique]

"Dip it in coarse salt. Not table salt - coarse sea salt or kosher salt
for texture."

[Build drink]

"Fill with ice. Add tequila and lime juice."

[Top with soda]

"Top with grapefruit soda. The pink color comes from the natural grapefruit
- no artificial coloring."

[Gentle stir]

"Gentle stir with your bar spoon. Just a couple rotations."

[Garnish]

"Garnish with a grapefruit wedge or lime wheel."

[Present under light]

"The Neon Paloma. Sweet, tart, and absolutely Instagram-worthy."
```

- Orange slice
- Ice"

[Build in glass]

"Build this directly in a wine glass or large rocks glass. Fill with ice."

[Layer liquids]

"Add your aperitif first, then Prosecco, then a splash of soda."

[Gentle stir]

"One gentle stir. You want to mix it but keep those bubbles alive."

[Garnish]

"Big orange slice, right in the glass. If you have it, add a sprig of
rosemary for that aromatic touch."

[Hold up to sunset/light]

"The Golden Hour Spritz. Named for that perfect moment when the sun sets
and everything glows gold."
